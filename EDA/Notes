STATA was used for initial EDA and to transform file into .csv and .txt
Summary statistics are provided and sample files
  -Note that STATA does not summaruze categorical data and 0 is not an indication of no value, but of non-numerical values
  -Patient IDs are not unique, will need to create a wider dataset with patient, encounter as unique identifier
  -Will add in visit number
  
Preprocessing for classification algorithm can be done by making metrics of symptoms, abnormal WBC, PaCO2, RR, HeartRate
Can make a metric for predispostion
Can weight various symptoms
May not need to add in medications initially because they can combat sepsis
May not need time, location and number of encounters
