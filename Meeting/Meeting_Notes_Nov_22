Meeting Notes:

What question do we want to tackle? This can be in the form of a query, algorithm, hypothesis... but needs to be comprehensive.
Classification algorithm will be beneficial and could have larger real world implications, AI can now diagnose... is this due to classification algorithms taking symptoms and lab results? Long term could evolve into NN
Moving forward with classification- HOW CAN WE PREPROCESS DATA WHAT FEATURES DO WE ACTUALLY NEED?
